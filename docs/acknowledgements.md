# Acknowledgements

CRANTpy is heavily based on **[fafbseg-py](https://github.com/flyconnectome/fafbseg-py)**, developed by **Dr. Philipp Schlegel** for the FlyWire Drosophila Connectome Project. We are deeply grateful for his foundational work, which has made this project possible.

### FlyWire Project

CRANTpy builds upon the tools and datasets developed by the FlyWire project, which has provided invaluable resources for the neuroscience community.

If you use CRANTpy in your research, please try to also cite the FlyWire paper:
